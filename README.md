# ExtendedAnalysisusingCICIoT2023
This repository elucidates on the significance of the proposed threat model on a larger volume of DDoS attacks appraised using the CICIoT2023 data set.
In this repository, we show the consistence of the proposed DNN model in the original model prediction, adversarial perturbation, adversarial training and parameter protection.



The jupyter file contains full details and diagrams.
